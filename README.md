JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Example

This is a simple example application demonstrating how to implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with Spring Boot.

Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- Apache Maven
- An IDE of your choice (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)

Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Configure the application:
   - Open the src/main/resources/application.properties file.
   - Update the following properties according to your preferences:
     - jwt.secret: The secret key used to sign and verify JWTs.
     - jwt.expiration: The expiration time (in milliseconds) for JWTs.
4. Build the project using Maven:
   mvn clean install
5. Run the application:
   mvn spring-boot:run
6. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

Usage
1. Register a new user by sending a POST request to /api/register with the following JSON payload:
   {
     "username": "your_username",
     "password": "your_password"
   }
2. Authenticate a user by sending a POST request to /api/authenticate with the following JSON payload:
   {
     "username": "your_username",
     "password": "your_password"
   }
3. If the authentication is successful, you will receive a response containing a JWT token.
4. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests by prefixing it with "Bearer ".
5. Access protected routes by sending requests with the JWT token in the Authorization header.

Configuration
The main configuration for JWT can be found in the src/main/java/com/example/security package. The key components are:
- JwtProvider.java: Handles the generation, parsing, and validation of JWT tokens.
- JwtAuthenticationFilter.java: Authenticates requests by validating JWT tokens.
- JwtAuthorizationFilter.java: Authorizes requests by checking the presence and validity of JWT tokens.
Feel free to modify the JWT configuration according to your specific requirements.
